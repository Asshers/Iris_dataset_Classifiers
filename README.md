# Iris_dataset_Classifiers
Iris Dataset with Multiple Classifiers

This repository contains the Iris dataset along with the implementation of five different classifiers for classification tasks. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of measurements of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with corresponding classification labels (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

The classifiers included in this repository are:

1. Logistic Regression: A binary classification algorithm that models the relationship between input variables and the probability of a particular outcome. It predicts the class label based on a predefined threshold.

2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A non-parametric algorithm that classifies new instances based on their similarity to the training instances. It assigns the class label by considering the k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

3. Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful supervised learning algorithm that can perform both classification and regression tasks. It finds the best hyperplane that separates different classes while maximizing the margin in a high-dimensional feature space.

4. Decision Tree: A hierarchical structure that represents a series of decisions and their consequences. It splits the dataset based on the feature values and makes predictions by traversing the tree.

5. Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees. It creates a diverse set of decision trees using random subsets of the dataset and features, and predicts the class label based on the majority vote of the trees.

This repository provides an opportunity to explore and compare the performance of these classifiers on the Iris dataset. The code is implemented in [programming language] and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Feel free to use and extend this repository for your own classification tasks or as a learning resource in machine learning. Contributions and improvements are always welcome.
